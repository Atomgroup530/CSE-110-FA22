## **BIO**

Hi, I'm Xun Liu 柳逊, 3rd year Computer Engineering student from Tianjin, China. I choose this major because solving prolems with softwares is fun and useful. I'm currently looking for an intern position in software engineering.

When I'm not studying computer or looking for a job, I play and make music with guitar, keybaord, and bass. I'm also enthusiastic about skateboarding, especially freestyle skateboarding.

Let me know if we share the same hobby, interest, or career goals :)
